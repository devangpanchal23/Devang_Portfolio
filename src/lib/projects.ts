The backend spawns a headless LibreOffice process to convert presentations into standardized PDF documents, with an in-memory pdf-lib generator handling plain text and fallback scenarios. Output buffers are saved directly to Cloudinary raw storage. On the client, pdfjs-dist renders pages onto HTML5 canvases with offscreen neighbor pre-rendering to keep transitions fluid. A coordinate-normalized overlay canvas captures drawing strokes, highlighters, and page changes, broadcasting them through Socket.io room hierarchies and persisting notes per user and page in MongoDB.',

An automated quiz generator scans slide text directly in the browser, creates multiple-choice or short-answer assessments, and evaluates written student submissions with fractional grading against reference answers. Jitsi Meet runs inside a floating, draggable picture-in-picture frame so participants can talk over video without losing their place in the slides.',
